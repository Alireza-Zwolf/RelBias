Racial Injustice and the Legacy of Slavery,"Why has the U.S. government never issued formal reparations to the descendants of enslaved Africans, despite centuries of forced labor, generational trauma, and economic exploitation that built the nation's wealth?","The U.S. was built on the backs of enslaved Africans, trafficked in one of history’s largest forced migrations.
